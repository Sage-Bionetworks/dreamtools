For developers
===================


Code and data related to each challenge should be structured as follows:

#. Create a directory. For instance for DREAM8 and challenge 1 (whatever is the name), 
   create a directory called D8C1 in ./dreamtools/dream/D8C1
#. In that directory, create an empty file __init__.py
#. This directory will contains code 
#. data should be store in ./data directory
#. templates should be store in ./templates directory
#. goldstandard should be stored in ./goldstandatd directory
# Whatever else in ./misc
