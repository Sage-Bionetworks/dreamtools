This directory contains tools for scoring of the 2 sub challenges of NIEHS-NCATS-UNC DREAM Toxicogenetics Challenge. 


Subchallenge 1
-----------

**Challenge description:** Predict interindividual variability in in vitro cytotoxicity based on genomic profiles of individual cell lines. For each compound, participants will be challenged to predict the absolute values and relative ranks of cytotoxicity across a set of unknown cell lines for which genomic data is available.

Subchallenge 2
-----------

**Challenge description:** For each compound, predict the concentration at which median cytotoxicity would occur, as well as inter-individual variation in cytotoxicity, described by the 5-95th%ile range, across the population. Each prediction will be scored based on the participantâ€™s ability to predict these two parameters within a set of compounds excluded from the training set.
